Part 4:Ethical reflection
To ensure my future AI project adheres to ethical principles, I will integrate fairness,
transparency, and privacy from the outset. Fairness will be maintained by carefully curating
training data, continuously testing for bias, and designing algorithms that provide equitable
outcomes for all users. Transparency will be ensured by documenting the AI system’s design
and making its decision-making process understandable, for example by providing clear
explanations of predictions or recommendations. Privacy will be protected by collecting only
the necessary data, securing it properly, and obtaining explicit user consent. I will also
address non-maleficence by conducting risk assessments to prevent harm and sustainability
by considering energy-efficient system design. By embedding these practices throughout the
project lifecycle, I aim to create an AI system that is trustworthy, accountable, and
responsible, ultimately benefiting both users and society.
