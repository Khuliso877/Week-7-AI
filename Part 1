Part 1:Theoretical Analysis
1:Understanding Algorithmic Bias in Artificial
Intelligence Systems
Algorithmic bias is the unfair or discriminatory outcomes produced by AI when the
data or model design favors certain groups.
Examples:
1. Facial recognition systems misidentify darker-skinned individuals more often.
2. Hiring algorithms favor male candidates due to biased historical data.
2: Transparency vs Explainability in AI:
Understanding the Difference and Importance
Transparency is openness about how an AI system is built, including data sources and
model design.
Explainability is the ability to understand why the AI made a specific decision.
Importance: Both support trust, accountability, fairness, and regulatory compliance.
3: The Impact of GDPR on AI Development in the
EU
GDPR impacts AI development in the EU by enforcing strict rules on how personal data is
collected, processed, and used. AI developers must follow principles like data minimization,
obtain clear user consent, and ensure transparency in data use. GDPR also restricts fully
automated decision-making and gives individuals rights such as access, correction, and
human review. Developers must conduct DPIAs, use privacy-by-design, and address risks
like bias and discrimination. Overall, GDPR ensures that AI systems are accountable, fair,
and protective of user privacy.
2. Ethical Principles Matching
● A) Justice → Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.
● B) Non-maleficence → Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.
● C) Autonomy → Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions.
● D) Sustainability → Designing AI to be environmentally friendly
