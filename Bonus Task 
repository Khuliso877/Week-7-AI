Policy Guideline for Ethical AI Use in Healthcare
1. Purpose and Scope
This guideline establishes the ethical, transparent, and responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems within healthcare environments. It applies to all AI tools used for diagnosis, monitoring, decision support, patient communication, and operational management.

2. Patient Consent Protocols
To uphold autonomy and protect patient rights, all AI-assisted healthcare interactions must follow strict consent requirements:

2.1 Informed Consent
Patients must be clearly informed when AI tools are being used in their care.
Information must include:
The AI system’s purpose
What data it uses
Expected benefits and limitations
Potential risks or uncertainties
Consent must be written or digitally recorded before data collection or model use.

2.2 Data Privacy & Protection
Only data essential to the AI’s function may be collected (“data minimization”).
Sensitive medical information must be anonymized or securely pseudonymized.
Patients must be informed of their rights to withdraw consent at any time without affecting their access to care.

2.3 Special Populations
Additional safeguards apply when dealing with minors, elderly individuals, or cognitively impaired patients.
Consent must be obtained from legal guardians or designated caregivers when necessary.

3. Bias Mitigation Strategies
AI systems must produce fair and equitable outcomes for all patients, regardless of demographic background.

3.1 Dataset Quality
Training data must be representative of the population served (age, race, gender, socioeconomic factors).
Regular audits must be conducted to detect imbalances or missing demographic segments.

3.2 Algorithmic Fairness
Models must be tested for disparate impact and subgroup performance.
Fairness-enhancing techniques (e.g., re-weighting, adversarial debiasing, equalized odds adjustments) should be employed where needed.

3.3 Human Oversight
Clinical professionals must remain final decision-makers.
AI outputs should never be used as the sole basis for high-risk medical decisions.

4. Transparency Requirements
AI systems must be understandable, traceable, and accountable.

4.1 Explainability
Patients and clinicians must have access to clear explanations of how AI reached its recommendations.
Visual explanation tools (e.g., feature importance, confidence scores) should be available.

4.2 Documentation
Developers and healthcare providers must maintain documentation including:
Data sources and preprocessing steps
Model architecture and training methodology
Known limitations and error rates
Intended use cases and prohibited uses

4.3 Accountability
Clear responsibility chains must be defined for data handling, model validation, deployment, and monitoring.
Any adverse outcomes linked to AI use must be promptly reported and reviewed by an ethics board.

5. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation
AI systems must undergo routine performance reviews, post-deployment audits, and re-certification.
Drift detection mechanisms must identify changes in model behaviour over time.
Updates or retraining must follow the same ethical standards as initial development.
